# hello-world
My first ever github project/repository.
//Um sure whatevers.
//I guess I'm just writing about the instructions.
//1.Click the 'README.md' file.
//2. Click the (picture of a pencil) pencil icon in the upper right corner of the file view to edit.
//3. In the editor, write a bit about yourself.
//4. Write a commit message that describes your changes.
//5. Colick 'Commit changes' button.
// Yeah so obviously all I did was add lines 3-10 inclusive of commentary.
